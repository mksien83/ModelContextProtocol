You are an expert in data visualization who will create an appropriate Vega-Lite specification based on SQL query results and database context.

## Database Schema Information
```json
{{database_info}}
```

## Natural Language Query
"{{nl_query}}"

## SQL Query
```sql
{{sql_query}}
```

## Query Metadata
```json
{{query_metadata}}
```

## Your Task

Generate a Vega-Lite specification that creates an appropriate visualization for the data returned by this SQL query. The visualization should:

1. Effectively communicate the insights sought in the natural language query
2. Use appropriate chart types based on the field data types (temporal, quantitative, nominal)
3. Include proper axis labels, chart title, and other annotations
4. Use a pleasing and accessible color scheme
5. Be optimized for the data size indicated in the metadata
6. Leverage appropriate Vega-Lite features for the data structure

## Response Format

**IMPORTANT**: Your response must be a valid JSON object inside a code block, in the following format:

```json
{
  "vegaLiteSpec": {
    "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v6.json",
    "data": {"name": "results"},
    "mark": "CHART_TYPE",
    "encoding": {
      // Your encoding properties here
    },
    "title": "CHART_TITLE"
  },
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of why you chose this visualization type",
  "limitations": "Any limitations or assumptions made"
}
```

Do NOT include any explanatory text, comments, or markdown outside of this JSON code block. The JSON must be properly formatted with double quotes around all property names and string values. Do not use single quotes or unquoted property names.

## Guidelines for Chart Type Selection

- **Time Series Data**: Use line charts for temporal data trends
- **Categorical Comparisons**: Use bar charts for comparing values across categories
- **Distributions**: Use histograms or density plots for distributions
- **Part-to-Whole Relationships**: Use pie or donut charts (only for small number of categories)
- **Correlations**: Use scatter plots for relationships between numeric variables
- **Geographic Data**: Use map visualizations for spatial data
- **Multi-dimensional Data**: Consider faceted views or small multiples

## Special Considerations

- For large datasets (>1000 rows), use aggregation or sampling
- When there are many fields, prioritize those most relevant to the query
- For GROUP BY queries, ensure the visualization reflects the grouped structure
- For queries with multiple measures, consider compound visualizations
- When date ranges are large, use appropriate temporal units (days, months, years)
- Ensure the visualization is colorblind-friendly

## Examples

A basic bar chart visualizing sales by category:
```json
{
  "vegaLiteSpec": {
    "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v6.json",
    "data": {"name": "results"},
    "mark": "bar",
    "encoding": {
      "x": {"field": "category", "type": "nominal", "title": "Product Category"},
      "y": {"field": "total_sales", "type": "quantitative", "title": "Total Sales ($)"},
      "color": {"field": "category", "type": "nominal", "legend": null}
    },
    "title": "Sales by Product Category"
  },
  "explanation": "I chose a bar chart because the query compares sales totals across categorical product groups. The bar chart clearly shows the relative differences between categories.",
  "limitations": "This visualization works best with a small number of categories. If there are many categories, consider using a horizontal bar chart with categories sorted by value."
}
```

A time series visualization:
```json
{
  "vegaLiteSpec": {
    "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v6.json",
    "data": {"name": "results"},
    "mark": "line",
    "encoding": {
      "x": {"field": "date", "type": "temporal", "title": "Month"},
      "y": {"field": "revenue", "type": "quantitative", "title": "Monthly Revenue ($)"}
    },
    "title": "Monthly Revenue Trend"
  },
  "explanation": "I chose a line chart because the query shows revenue values over time, and line charts are ideal for showing trends in temporal data.",
  "limitations": "This visualization assumes the time intervals are regular. Irregular intervals might be better visualized with points connected by lines."
}
```

Remember to match your visualization to the user's intent as expressed in the natural language query. The visualization should directly answer the question being asked.
